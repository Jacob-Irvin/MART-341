                        <p>Before continuing on, I want to stress the fact that this is how <b>I</b> would personally style what <b>I</b> consider a casual outfit. 
                        The outfit I am showing is <B>MY OWN</B> style preference and is only meant to be inspiration for you, in the hopes that you find your own style 
                        and mix it up however would make you feel the best in your own skin. This is not how I think everyone should dress, it is completely open for your interpretation. With that said, lets get on to it.</p>

                <h2>Tips:</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                        <style>
                            li {text-align: left;}
                        </style>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When I start putting together a casual "everyday" outfit, I first narrow down my wardrobe to my basic essential pieces that I wear the most and that will go with anything. The pieces you're left with will be perfect for whatever the day might throw at you.</li>
                            <li>This is just a personal preference, but I am a big sneakerhead so I always start with my shoes and work my way up. Alot of my personal wardrobe is very basic and low-key, so the shoes is where I add my flare. Thats why I start there. </li>

                <h1><ins>Into the Outfit</ins></h1>
                
                <h2>Step 1: The kicks</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="Images/Kicks.jpg">
                        <p>For a casual outfit like this one, I would recommend a simple, low-key sillouette that will go with absolutely anything; a white leather sneaker, for example. For me, it is almost always the Nike Blazer. The Blazer is a shoe that only looks better the more worn and dirty it gets. Thats why it's the perfect match for an "everyday" kind of outfit. I like the original 1977 pair with the green swoosh. My wardbrobe does not include a lot of color so the subtle hint of green adds the "pop" that this outfit needs.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Bottoms</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="Images/Jeans.jpg">
                        <p>For this particular outfit the bottoms are a no-brainer. Stick with your favorite, go-to pair of blue jeans. My favorite is the Levi 511 because I prefer a slimmer fit. A good broken in pair of your favorite jeans that fit you just right from countless wears will do perfeclty for this. Being comfortable is always crucial, especially with a casual outfit like this one that you'll be wearing all day. Dark indigo or raw denim jeans are my personal favorite washes because they are so versatile, I typically wear them casually for everyday use, but if something unexpected comes up later in the day you can always trade in the t-shirt and sneakers for a white button down shirt and some loafers for that "smart-casual" look and you're set. </p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Step 3: Tops</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="Images/Jacket.jpg">
                        <p>The top is very important, especially in a casual outfit like this one. Underneath, just throw on a solid color t-shirt of your choice. Try and stick with neutral colors, I almost always wear white, sometimes black if im feeling adventurous. Over that, your favorite jacket. This is the piece that should pull the entire outfit together. Almost any jacket you can think of will look good with the base outfit we've set up already. There are countless options and so much room for self expression when it comes to jackets. The most important thing is to make sure it is one that you like and feel the most "yourself" in. My go-to is almost always a black leather jacket. I try and stick with high quality, timeless pieces that will last forever and never go out of style. If a black leather jacket isn't your thing, I would also recommend either a denim trucker jacket or neutral color bomber backet. Most importantly just make sure it is something you feel good in. Your jacket is what is going to make you stand out and make this outfit we've put together your own. </p>
                    </div>

                <h2>Step 4: Accessories</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                        <img src="Images/Accessories.jpg">
                        <p>Our last step to top this perfect outfit off is accessories. Just a little something to add some flare. If accessories aren't your thing, feel free to skip this step entirely (but I would recommend at least giving it a shot). Accessories can be one of the best ways to express your own sense of style. Whether it's jewerley, hats, sunglasses, or all the above, there is something out there for everyone. You can wear as little or as many accessories as you like, once again I want to stress that you just embrace your personal style whatever it may be. However, I would recommened keeping it pretty low-key with accessories. Too much can easily ruin an outift. Just make sure they are balanced well. The accessories that I wear everyday is always jewelry, usually a hat of some kind, and if the weather permits, some sunglasses. The jewerly I always wear no matter the outfit is my chain, my watch, and a ring. All of which have sentimental value to me because they were either gifted to me or made my people I am very close to. I stick with silver jewelry because I find yellow gold to be a bit much for my style. I usually always wear a hat, for this outfit just a black baseball cap will be perfect. In the spring or fall a beanie would be a nice fit as well. My personal favorite sunglasses are just black aviators because they have that classic, timeless look that I love so much. Accessories can elevate any outfit and are great for self-expression. Like I said before, try to keep it at a minimum with a casual outfit like this one. </p>
