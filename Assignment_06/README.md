1. The main head and body documents could technically have as many elements as  you wanted, there are some that are considered "required" but there is really no limit.

3. I am very proud to admit that I didn't have many challenges with the assignment this week. At least one topic usually trips me up but I felt that this weeks lesson was very straightforward and easy for me to understand, along with the homework as well! I really appreciate the "Code-play" practices, I think those make a big difference in being able to fully grasp the material, at least for me.
