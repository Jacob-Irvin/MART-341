1. My imaginary client was some sort of outdoor adventure website, like a national park website or something along those lines. That's the look I was going for. Their site needs were making sure contacting them was straightforward and easy to manage, as well as just showing off the photos of the area. 
2. It is important to consider mobile-first design becuase that is where the majoriety of your viewers are going to see your website. More people will view it on their phone than a laptop or a desktop.
3. I sort of struggled with this whole assignment, especially creating a drop down box as well as the hover feature. I am still just getting comfortable with coding in general due to the fact I am very new to it.  I think this assignment was a good learning experience either way and I understand certain things better now for future assignments.
