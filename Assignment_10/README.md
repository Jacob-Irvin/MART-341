1.A universal selector can be used to style every element on a page, the elemental selector can select all elements of a specific type, the class selector allows you to style elements via the "class" attribute, and lastly the ID selector allows to to style one specific element by calling its unique ID. 

2.The three colors I chose were turquoise, red, and black. This is because as I was browsing through photos for this assignment a common theme I noticed amongst the photos whether it was fashion, vechicles, or buildings was usually turquoise and red. I then chose black because I cant think of the 50's without thinking of black biker jackets and greased back black hair.

3.The only real challenge I had to overcome was remebering how to style certain aspects of div tags. It was an easy fix after reffering back to previous lessons and assignments.
