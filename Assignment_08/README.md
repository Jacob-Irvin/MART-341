1. From my understanding, the differences between the "building blocks of pages" are that divs are used to group elements together to add some structural clarity, spans are basically smaller divs that reside within a div to add extra styling or organization without creating a whole block. Ids are something that uniquley identifies a div, and classes group similiar attribute types together. 
2. The advantages for sourcing videos from places like Youtube or Vimeo is that is is easy and you have access to almost any video you need, but the disadvantes are things like not crediting the creator properly or using videos that you're not allowed to. 
3. The biggest challenges I faced were sourcing the audio and video for the project. I think I figured it out, or at least how it is supposed to work, but trying to find the correct audio and video was sort of a challenge.
