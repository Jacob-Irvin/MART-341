I went to Levis.com, it looked A LOT different than it does now and it has defienetly changed for the better, as you'd imagine. It is a lot more user friendly, the arcitecture of the site is different, and it is more sophisticated today than 10 years ago.
The main thing that I think I learned was the easiest way to embed images. Ive seemed to struggle a bit with it so far but this lesson really cleared it up for. I am very comfortable with everything else we covered also.
